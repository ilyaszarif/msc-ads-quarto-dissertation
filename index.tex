\hypertarget{sec-intro}{%
\chapter{Introduction}\label{sec-intro}}

This is where you introduce the main ideas of your thesis, and an
overview of the context and background.

In a PhD, Chapter 2 would normally contain a literature review.
Typically, Chapters 3--5 would contain your own contributions. Think of
each of these as potential papers to be submitted to journals. Finally,
Chapter 6 provides some concluding remarks, discussion, ideas for future
research, and so on. Appendixes can contain additional material that
don't fit into any chapters, but that you want to put on record. For
example, additional tables, output, etc.

\hypertarget{quarto}{%
\section{Quarto}\label{quarto}}

In this template, the rest of the chapter shows how to use quarto. The
big advantage of using quarto is that it allows you to include your R or
Python code directly into your thesis, to ensure there are no errors in
copying and pasting, and that everything is reproducible. It also helps
you stay better organized.

For details on using Quarto, see \url{http://quarto.org}.

\hypertarget{data}{%
\section{Data}\label{data}}

Included in this template is a file called \texttt{sales.csv}. This
contains quarterly data on Sales and Advertising budget for a small
company over the period 1981--2005. It also contains the GDP (gross
domestic product) over the same period. All series have been adjusted
for inflation. We can load in this data set using the following code:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{sales }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ readr}\SpecialCharTok{::}\FunctionTok{read\_csv}\NormalTok{(here}\SpecialCharTok{::}\FunctionTok{here}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"data/sales.csv"}\NormalTok{)) }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%}
  \FunctionTok{rename}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{Quarter =} \StringTok{\textasciigrave{}}\AttributeTok{...1}\StringTok{\textasciigrave{}}\NormalTok{) }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%}
  \FunctionTok{mutate}\NormalTok{(}
    \AttributeTok{Quarter =} \FunctionTok{as.Date}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{paste0}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"01{-}"}\NormalTok{, Quarter), }\StringTok{"\%d{-}\%b{-}\%y"}\NormalTok{),}
    \AttributeTok{Quarter =} \FunctionTok{yearquarter}\NormalTok{(Quarter)}
\NormalTok{  ) }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%}
  \FunctionTok{as\_tsibble}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{index =}\NormalTok{ Quarter)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
New names:
Rows: 100 Columns: 4
-- Column specification
-------------------------------------------------------- Delimiter: "," chr

i Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data. i
Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.
* `` -> `...1`
\end{verbatim}

Any data you use in your thesis can go into the \texttt{data} directory.
The data should be in exactly the format you obtained it. Do no editing
or manipulation of the data prior to including it in the \texttt{data}
directory. Any data munging should be scripted and form part of your
thesis files (possibly hidden in the output).

\hypertarget{figures}{%
\section{Figures}\label{figures}}

Figure~\ref{fig-deaths} shows time plots of the data we just loaded.
Notice how figure captions and references work. Chunk names can be used
as figure labels with \texttt{fig-} prefixed. Never manually type figure
numbers, as they can change when you add or delete figures. This way,
the figure numbering is always correct.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{01-chap1_files/figure-pdf/fig-deaths-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-deaths}Quarterly sales, advertising and GDP data.}

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{results-from-analyses}{%
\section{Results from analyses}\label{results-from-analyses}}

We can fit a dynamic regression model to the sales data.

\begin{verbatim}
Series: Sales
Model: LM w/ ARIMA(1,0,0)(0,1,1)[4] errors

Coefficients:
         ar1     sma1     GDP  AdBudget
      0.2189  -0.9016  0.9742    2.2824
s.e.  0.1022   0.0715  0.4387    0.3930

sigma^2 estimated as 1677:  log likelihood=-493.94
AIC=997.87   AICc=998.54   BIC=1010.69
\end{verbatim}

If \(y_t\) denotes the sales in quarter \(t\), \(x_t\) denotes the
corresponding advertising budget and \(z_t\) denotes the GDP, then the
resulting model is: \begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-drm}{}{
  y_t - y_{t-4} = \beta (x_t-x_{t-4}) + \gamma (z_t-z_{t-4}) + \phi_1 (y_{t-1} - y_{t-5}) + \Theta_1 \varepsilon_{t-4} + \varepsilon_t
}\label{eq-drm}\end{equation} where \(\beta = 2.28\), \(\gamma = 0.97\),
\(\phi_1 = 0.22\), and \(\Theta_1 = -0.90\). We can reference this
equation using Equation~\ref{eq-drm}.

\hypertarget{tables}{%
\section{Tables}\label{tables}}

Let's assume future advertising spend and GDP are at the current levels.
Then forecasts for the next year are given in
Table~\ref{tbl-salesforecasts}.

\hypertarget{tbl-salesforecasts}{}
\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lr@{}}
\caption{\label{tbl-salesforecasts}Forecasts for the next year assuming
Advertising budget and GDP are unchanged.}\tabularnewline
\toprule\noalign{}
Quarter & Sales forecast \\
\midrule\noalign{}
\endfirsthead
\toprule\noalign{}
Quarter & Sales forecast \\

\endlastfoot
2006 Q1 & 1000.2 \\
2006 Q2 & 1013.1 \\
2006 Q3 & 1076.7 \\
2006 Q4 & 1003.5 \\
\end{longtable}

Again, notice the use of labels and references to automatically generate
table numbers.

\hypertarget{sec-methodology}{%
\chapter{Literature Review}\label{sec-methodology}}

This chapter contains a summary of the context in which your research is
set.

Imagine you are writing for your fellow PhD students. Topics that are
well-known to them do not have to be included here. But things that they
may not know about should be included.

Resist the temptation to discuss everything you've read in the last few
years. And you are not writing a textbook either. This chapter is meant
to provide the background necessary to understand the material in
subsequent chapters. Stick to that.

You will need to organize the literature review around themes, and
within each theme provide a story explaining the development of ideas to
date. In each theme, you should get to the point where your ideas will
fit in. But leave your ideas to later chapters. This way it is clear
what has been done beforehand, and what new contributions you are making
to the research field.

All citations should be done using markdown notation as shown below.
This way, your bibliography will be compiled automatically and
correctly.

\hypertarget{sec-expsmooth}{%
\section{Exponential smoothing}\label{sec-expsmooth}}

Exponential smoothing methods were originally developed in the late
1950s (Brown, 1959, 1963; Holt, 1957; Winters, 1960). Because of their
computational simplicity and interpretability, they became widely used
in practice.

Empirical studies by Makridakis \& Hibon (1979) and Makridakis et al.
(1982) found little difference in forecast accuracy between exponential
smoothing and ARIMA models. This made the family of exponential
smoothing procedures an attractive proposition (see Chatfield et al.,
2001).

The methods were less popular in academic circles until Ord et al.
(1997) introduced a state space formulation of some of the methods,
which was extended in Hyndman et al. (2002) to cover the full range of
exponential smoothing methods.
